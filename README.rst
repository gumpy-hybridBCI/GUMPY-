Deep Learning models for Brain Computer Interfaces
=================================================

This repository contains deep learning models that can be used to decode EEG and
EEG signals for brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Some of the models depend on
the functionality that is provided by ``gumpy``, a python toolbox that contains
several signal and feature processing routines that are commonly used for BCIs.
